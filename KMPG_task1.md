Dear [Client],

We have completed our initial data quality assessment for the dataset provided, and have identified some issues that may impact the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.

Some of the key issues we have identified include:

-   Missing values: Approximately 3.04% of the data is missing in the Customer Demographic data; 0.59% of the data is missing in the Transaction Data; no data is missing in the Customer Address data. Those may affect our ability to accurately analyze and model the data. 

-   Inconsistencies: 
	- The data contains no duplicate entries. 
	- Other inconsistencies in the data, such as contradictory values, may have influenced the accuracy of our study. Customer Demographic data has 4000 data in count, maximum id is 4000 and 4000 unique id; Customer Address data has 3999 data in the count, maximum id is 4003 and 3999 unique id; Transaction Data table has the max id of 5034 and 3494 unique id.
	-  Inconsistencies in gender,  state variables and in data types. 
	

-   Data types: Some of the variables have incorrect data types, which may affect the validity of our analysis.

To address these issues, we recommend the following strategies:

-   Imputing missing values: We can use various statistical techniques, such as mean imputation or multiple imputation, to estimate the missing values and improve the completeness of the dataset.

-   Cleaning inconsistencies: We can use various data cleaning techniques, such as deduplication and data scrubbing, to remove any inconsistencies from the dataset and improve its accuracy.
	- The gender is replaced to Female, Male and Unspecified in Demographic; state is replaced to NSW, VIC and QLD.

-   Converting data types: We can convert the incorrect data types to the appropriate type, such as converting text to numerical values, to ensure that the data is properly formatted and ready for analysis.
	- Change the data type for modelling e.g. transaction_date to datetime64 Dtype.

Overall, these strategies should help to improve the quality of the dataset and ensure that our analysis is accurate and reliable. 

Our team will continue with the data cleaning, standardisation, and transformation process in preparation for model analysis. Along the process, questions will be posed and assumptions will be documented. After we finish this, we'd like to meet with your data expert to check that all assumptions are in line with Sprocket Central's knowledge.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely, Huining
